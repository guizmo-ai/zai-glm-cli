ISSUES AT A GLANCE:
==================

CRITICAL (2):
  ✗ Synchronous file operations blocking startup
  ✗ Extra API calls for context compression

HIGH (5):
  ✗ Unbounded chat history memory growth
  ✗ Inefficient token counting (O(n²))
  ✗ Redundant token counting API calls
  ✗ Artificial streaming delay (10ms per word)
  ✗ Message reducer creating copies

MEDIUM (8):
  ✗ EventEmitter listener leaks
  ✗ Metrics file unlimited growth
  ✗ Search pattern duplication
  ✗ DiffGenerator overhead
  ✗ History manager file I/O
  ✗ Confirmation service no timeout
  ✗ API streaming inefficiency
  ✗ Context management API call

LOW (4):
  ✗ Tiktoken bundle size
  ✗ Animation dependencies
  ✗ Package dependencies
  ✗ Unnecessary imports

QUICK WINS (Fix in <1 hour total):
==================================

1. Remove artificial streaming delay (5 min)
   Impact: 5-15 seconds faster responses
   Location: src/agent/zai-agent.ts:846

2. Add token count caching (30 min)
   Impact: 10-20% faster token updates
   Location: src/agent/zai-agent.ts

3. Debounce token emissions (20 min)
   Impact: 20% less event processing
   Location: src/agent/zai-agent.ts

4. Lazy-load animation dependencies (1 hour)
   Impact: 100-200ms faster startup
   Location: src/index.ts

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
=====================

Phase 1 (1-2 hours):
  ✓ 10x faster streaming responses
  ✓ 100-200ms faster startup
  ✓ 20% less event overhead

Phase 2 (1-2 days):
  ✓ Stable memory even in long sessions
  ✓ No unexpected latency spikes
  ✓ All file operations non-blocking
  ✓ Metrics won't degrade startup

Phase 3 (1 week):
  ✓ 25-35% faster startup overall
  ✓ 2-3 MB smaller bundle
  ✓ 10-15% fewer API calls
  ✓ Performance monitoring in place
