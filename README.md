> A conversational AI CLI tool powered by Z.ai GLM models with intelligent text editing and tool usage.

Forked from [superagent-ai/grok-cli](https://github.com/superagent-ai/grok-cli) and enhanced with advanced features for the Z.ai GLM ecosystem.

## ✨ New in v0.2.0

Powerful new features to enhance your workflow:

- **📜 Persistent Command History** - Your command history is saved across sessions in `~/.zai/history.json`, so you never lose your workflow
- **🔍 Ctrl+R Fuzzy Search** - Instantly find and reuse previous commands with reverse search through your history
- **👁️ Interactive Diff Viewer** - Preview all file changes before applying them, with options to accept, reject, or view full diffs
- **💾 Automatic Backups** - Files are automatically backed up before editing to `~/.zai/backups/`, ensuring you can always recover previous versions

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **↑/↓** - Navigate through command history
- **Ctrl+R** - Reverse search through command history (fuzzy search)
- **Diff Viewer:**
  - `a` - Accept changes and apply to file
  - `r` - Reject changes and discard
  - `d` - Toggle between summary and full diff view

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from npm (recommended)
npm install -g @guizmo-ai/zai-cli

# Or with Bun
bun add -g @guizmo-ai/zai-cli
```

### First Run

```bash
zai
```

The interactive wizard will guide you through:
1. Enter your Z.ai API key ([get one here](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list))
2. Select default model (GLM-4.6 recommended)
3. Start chatting!

Configuration is saved to `~/.zai/user-settings.json`.

## ✨ What's Different from grok-cli?

- **GLM-4.5** (128K context) - Balanced performance
- **GLM-4.5-Air** - Fast and lightweight

### 📝 Smart File Operations
AI automatically:
- Views, creates, and edits files with **interactive diff preview**
- Executes shell commands with **persistent history**
- Selects appropriate tools
- Handles multi-file operations with **automatic backups**
- **Ctrl+R fuzzy search** through command history

### ⚙️ Settings Management

```bash
# Interactive settings panel
zai config

# View configuration
zai config --show

# Update API key
zai config --set-key YOUR_KEY

# Reset to defaults
zai config --reset
```

### 💻 Usage Modes

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
zai                          # Start in current directory
zai -d /path/to/project     # Specify working directory
```

**Headless Mode** (for scripts/CI):
```bash
zai --prompt "analyze package.json and suggest improvements"
zai -p "run tests" --max-tool-rounds 50
```

### 🎨 Model Selection

```bash
# Command line
zai --model glm-4.6

# Environment variable
export ZAI_MODEL=glm-4.5
zai

# User settings (persistent)
zai config  # Select "Change Default Model"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
export ZAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export ZAI_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4  # Optional
export ZAI_MODEL=glm-4.6                           # Optional
```

### Custom Instructions

Create `.zai/ZAI.md` in your project:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow functional programming patterns
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Write tests for all new features
```

ZAI will automatically follow these instructions when working in your project.

### Project Settings

Create `.zai/settings.json` for project-specific configuration:

```json
{
  "model": "glm-4.5",
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "name": "linear",
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔌 MCP Integration

Extend ZAI with Model Context Protocol servers:

```bash
# Add Linear integration
zai mcp add linear --transport sse --url https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Add custom MCP server
zai mcp add my-server --transport stdio --command "bun" --args server.js

# List servers
zai mcp list

# Test connection
zai mcp test linear
```

## ⚡ Morph Fast Apply (Optional)

Enable high-speed editing at 4,500+ tokens/sec:

```bash
export MORPH_API_KEY=your_morph_key
```

When enabled:
- `edit_file` tool for complex refactoring
- Intelligent diff-based editing
- 98% accuracy on code changes

## 📊 Advanced Features

### 📜 Command History & Search
Your command history is automatically saved across sessions:
```bash
# History saved to ~/.zai/history.json
# Use ↑/↓ to navigate through previous commands
# Press Ctrl+R for fuzzy search through history
```

**Pro tip:** The history search supports fuzzy matching, so you can quickly find commands even if you don't remember the exact wording.

### 👁️ Interactive Diff Viewer
Preview all file changes before they're applied:
```bash
# When AI suggests file changes, you'll see:
# - Side-by-side diff view
# - Summary of changes
# - Options to accept (a), reject (r), or view full diff (d)
```

This ensures you maintain full control over what changes are made to your codebase.

### 💾 Automatic Backups
Every file edit is automatically backed up:
```bash
# Backups stored in ~/.zai/backups/
# Organized by timestamp
# Easy recovery if something goes wrong
```

### Session Persistence
Save and restore conversations:
```bash
# Sessions auto-save to ~/.zai/sessions/
# Restore on restart with full context
```

### Batch Editing
Apply changes across multiple files in one operation:
```bash
zai --prompt "rename function foo to bar in all .ts files"
```

### File Watching
Real-time detection when files change outside ZAI:
```bash
# Automatic notification when watched files are modified
# Prevents conflicts and lost work
```

### Thinking Mode
Visualize AI reasoning (GLM extended thinking):
```bash
# See reasoning steps in real-time
# Understand decision-making process
# Available with GLM-4.6
```
